### What App Does

**Techy-Scraper-News** is a fluid and responsive React.js single-page application which primarily interacts with the Google Books API to fetch and render books data. The frontend is composed of components. Form inputs, the Grid layouts and basic details are borrowed from Bootstrap. Saved books are stored in a MongoDB database hosted in the cloud with Heroku's mLab and served via express.js routes.


### Tech Used

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community) - a NoSQL database program with ability to create dynamic objects /collections
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - framework to build back end routing and the server
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - a frontend open source library that specializes in helping to build user interfaces (UIs)
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - run-time environment to build a back-end server
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - an integrated toolchain to help with setup and configuration
* [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/) - to search for big data books  
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JavaScript library for DOM traversal and manipulation
* [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started) - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML used to perform a callback, making a quick round trip to and from the server to retrieve and/or save data without posting the entire page back to the server
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/) - an Object Document Mapper (ODM) JavaScript library used to store, save, delete comments and articles mapped to a MongoDB
* [Body-Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) - middleware used to extract the body from the incoming requests
* [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) - the simplest way possible to make http calls
* [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) - component library for a front-end responsive framework
* [HTML](https://html.com/) - create pages/documents to be displayed in a web browser
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_intro.asp) - customizing content, layout, colors, and fonts
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - scripting language used to implement client-side dynamic behavior on HTML web pages
* [Heroku](https://html.com/) - a cloud Platform to deploy, manage, and scale the app


### Built With
- Visual Studio Code - Text Editor




<!-- # Create React Express App

## About This Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest. -->
